# Original Intervention: PRE-test Questions & Adaptive Logic

## Adaptive Skip Logic

**Rule**: If student gets **2/2 correct on PRE-test** → Skip video, show 1-sentence summary
**Rule**: If student gets **<2/2** → Show full video

Each topic has 2 PRE-test questions:
1. **Definition question** (What is X?)
2. **Scenario question** (Which student does X best?)

## Module 1: Learning Strategies

### 1.1 PRE: Self-testing
**Gates**: Video on self-testing

**Q1 (Definition)**: Self-testing is a useful learning strategy for what reason?
- ✅ It helps emphasize retrieval practice and bring back information you already know
- ✅ It helps students remember key information for a longer period of time
- ✅ It helps with future learning
- ❌ (Other options about goal-setting, etc.)

*Note: Multiple correct answers - students need to recognize all 3 benefits*

**Q2 (Scenario)**: You just began a unit with 4 weeks before the exam. Pick the best strategy to rehearse knowledge:
- ❌ **Block out entire day before exam, redo all homework** → "Good retrieval but no spacing"
- ❌ **Block out entire day before exam, reread all chapters** → "Rereading is inefficient, risk of overconfidence"
- ❌ **After reading each chapter, reread repeatedly before exam** → "Good spacing but no retrieval practice"
- ✅ **After turning in homework, set reminders to re-complete it a few times before exam** → "Best: retrieval practice + spacing"

---

### 1.2 PRE: Spacing
**Gates**: Video on spacing effect

**Q1 (Definition)**: What does the spacing effect show?
- ✅ Learning is more effective when spread out over time versus crammed before a test
- ❌ Learning is more effective when you study once every two months → "Too spread out"
- ❌ Cramming before a test is better → "Cramming only helps short-term"
- ❌ Learning is better when your environment is spacious → "Spacing has nothing to do with environment"

**Q2 (Scenario)**: Pick the study plan that makes best use of spacing:
- ❌ **Ana**: Downloaded outlines after each class, reviewed all before exam → "No spaced retrieval"
- ❌ **Brad**: Reviewed all released materials every single night → "Not enough time per item, no gaps"
- ✅ **Cora**: Review that night → 3 days later → 1 week later → before exam → "Best spacing with progressive delays"
- ❌ **Deneshia**: In the week before exam, reviewed every other day → "Only one week isn't enough time"

### 1.3 PRE: Self-explanation
**Gates**: Video on self-explanation

**Q1 (Definition)**: What is self-explanation?
- ❌ Working out a math problem in front of peers
- ✅ Trying to explain new information to yourself and make sense of the content
- ❌ Repeatedly reviewing tests you've taken
- ❌ Attending a peer-review session where they explain to you

**Q2 (Scenario)**: Upcoming exam on cellular respiration. How to study?
- ❌ **A**: Read closely, again and again until you know it
- ❌ **B**: Transcribe details exactly into notebook
- ✅ **C**: Write what you remember, check against textbook, highlight gaps, restudy, explain again
- ✅ **D**: Practice explaining to another student, have them point out gaps, discuss together
- ❌ **E**: Rehearse individual pieces repeatedly

*Note: Both C and D are correct (self-explanation principle)*

## Module 2: Self-Regulated Learning

### 2.1 PRE: SRL Part 1 (Define the Task)
**Gates**: Video on 4-stage SRL model

**Q1 (Definition)**: What is self-regulated learning?
- ❌ Regulating your peer's learning
- ✅ Taking charge of your learning and monitoring your progress throughout
- ❌ Asking teacher how they learn best and copying
- ❌ Planning to learn a lot 2 days before a test

**Q2 (Scenario)**: Which student effectively completes the first stage (defining the task)?
- ❌ **Alice**: Assigns calendar blocks for readings, focuses on vocabulary → "Doesn't consider instructor's objectives"
- ❌ **Barry**: Color-codes materials by concept → "Doesn't consider objectives or expected understanding level"
- ❌ **Cora**: Reviews course objectives, commits learning objectives to memory → "Good start but needs to analyze LEVEL of understanding required"
- ✅ **Dana**: Consults learning objectives, considers topic AND level of understanding needed for exams → "Understands instructor's focus and expectations"

---

### 2.2 PRE: SRL Goals
**Gates**: Video on goal-setting (SMART criteria)

**Q1 (Definition - Multi-select)**: What important characteristics should subgoals have?
- ✅ Achievable
- ✅ Near-term
- ✅ Specific
- ❌ Long-term
- ✅ Relevant

**Q2 (Scenario)**: Student wants to get an A in biology. Which is the best sub-goal?
- ❌ **Anne**: Read as many pages as possible before test in 5 days → "Not specific"
- ❌ **Bob**: Study all study guides before final, a little each day → "Too long-term, not specific"
- ✅ **Clyde**: Study/read one chapter each day until test in 7 days → "Specific, relevant, achievable, near-term"
- ❌ **Dani**: Read 400-page textbook in 5 days → "Not achievable"

---

### 2.3 PRE: SRL Monitoring
**Gates**: Video on monitoring your learning

**Q1 (Definition)**: What does monitoring your learning effectively mean?
- ✅ Adapt your learning to accommodate what you don't know
- ❌ Watching other students and following them
- ❌ Rereading textbook passages
- ❌ Rereading missed questions until memorized

**Q2 (Scenario)**: Which student monitors their learning the best?
- ❌ **Anish**: Monitors what friends do and copies their strategies → "Should monitor himself, not others"
- ❌ **Bria**: Rereads textbook until memorized → "Rereading is ineffective and doesn't help monitoring"
- ❌ **Carrie**: Tests herself with flashcards repetitively → "No check-in to see if strategy is working"
- ✅ **Denise**: After one self-test, asks herself if she's retaining information with this strategy → "Self-monitoring with adaptation"

---

## Module 3: Achieve Your Goals (MCII)

### 3.1 PRE: Mental Contrasting
**Gates**: Video on mental contrasting

**Q1 (Definition)**: Which best defines what mental contrasting helps you do?
- ✅ Helps combine concepts of indulging and dwelling into goals so you can pursue them
- ❌ Helps turn behaviors into habits
- ❌ Helps you think too much about how good achieving the goal would feel
- ❌ Helps you think about all obstacles

**Q2 (Scenario)**: Student wants to walk 30 min daily. Who uses mental contrasting best?
- ❌ **Addy**: Thinks about difficulty finding time, THEN thinks about relaxing reset → "Wrong order (dwell before indulge)"
- ❌ **Blair**: Only thinks about how good a walk would feel → "Only indulging"
- ✅ **Carrie**: Thinks about relaxation/health benefits, THEN thinks about time constraints → "Correct order: indulge THEN dwell"
- ❌ **Darryl**: Only thinks about how time-consuming it would be → "Only dwelling"

---

### 3.2 PRE: Implementation Intentions
**Gates**: Video on implementation intentions

**Q1 (Definition)**: What characteristics should implementation intentions have?
- ✅ They should be specific so you can address each obstacle, but not too many
- ❌ Should address all obstacles (7-9) → "Too many = confusing"
- ❌ Should be vague so you can adapt → "Need to be specific"
- ❌ Should only create one → "Can have a few, just not too many"

**Q2 (Scenario)**: Student wants to lose 5 pounds. Who uses implementation intentions effectively?
- ✅ **Anna**: Makes schedule to go to gym at 7:30 AM before classes → "Specific, focused on one obstacle (time)"
- ❌ **Barry**: Goes to gym whenever he has time → "Too vague"
- ❌ **Claire**: Creates detailed schedule for many obstacles (gym location, meal prep, babysitting) → "Too many at once"
- ❌ **Derek**: Goes to gym after cooking healthy meal, until visible results → "Vague conditions"

## Recommendation: Replace Current Knowledge Checks

Replace current knowledge check questions with these original scenario-based questions because:
1. **Better designed** - Each wrong answer has specific educational feedback
2. **Scenario-based** - Tests application, not just recall
3. **Named characters** - More engaging (Ana, Brad, Cora, etc.)
4. **Nuanced feedback** - Explains WHY each wrong answer is wrong

### Implementation Options

**Option A: Full Adaptive (like original)**
- Show PRE-test before video
- If 2/2 correct → Skip video, show summary
- If <2/2 → Show video

**Option B: Fixed Path + Better Questions**
- Keep current video-first flow
- Replace knowledge check questions with these scenario questions
- No adaptive skipping (simpler for research)

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Show one quick PRE-test question before video
- If correct → Can skip video (optional)
- If incorrect → Must watch video
- Then show second scenario question as knowledge check
