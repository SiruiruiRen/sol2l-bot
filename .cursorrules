# SoLBot Learning Platform - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
SoLBot is a research-focused AI learning platform implementing evidence-based learning techniques. This is an educational intervention system designed for academic research and publication.

## Development Workflow
1. **User-Centered Design**: All changes must be based on specific user feedback with documented rationale
2. **Research Documentation**: Maintain detailed logs of design iterations for academic publication
3. **Git Workflow**: Stage → Commit with descriptive messages → Push to main branch for auto-deployment
4. **Testing Focus**: Prioritize efficient database setup and comprehensive analytics for research
5. **Auto-Update Log**: When making significant changes, update `docs/design_iterations_log.md` with new iteration entry

## Key Principles
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Eliminate redundancy, use concise communication, maintain consistency
- **Educational Value**: Transform all interactions into learning opportunities with research-backed approaches  
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Track detailed user behaviors for learning science research
- **Iterative Improvement**: Document rationale for every design decision

## Technical Guidelines
- **Database**: Use Supabase with comprehensive analytics tables for research data collection
- **UI/UX**: Single-column layouts, compact design, consistent "SoLBot" branding
- **Components**: Follow established patterns (guided interactions, educational loading messages)
- **Analytics**: Implement granular tracking (video engagement, chat patterns, revision attempts, learning efficiency)

## File Structure Priorities
- `/app` - Next.js application with phase-based learning modules
- `/database` - SQL schemas and analytics queries for research
- `/docs` - Design iteration logs and research documentation
- `/components` - Reusable UI components following established patterns

## Research Requirements
- Track user revision patterns and score improvements
- Monitor video engagement and chat interaction quality
- Collect learning efficiency and progression metrics
- Support evidence-based research conclusions for academic publication

## Development Rules
1. Make focused changes to satisfy current requirements - avoid unnecessary new features
2. Avoid creating temporary files or too many new files to prevent confusion
3. Always document design changes in the iteration log with user feedback rationale
4. Ensure database queries handle empty tables gracefully for testing phase
5. Maintain comprehensive data collection capabilities for research analysis

## Log Update Template (Use for significant changes)
```
### Iteration X: [Title]
**Date**: [Date] | **Commit**: `[hash]` | **Status**: ✅ Complete
**User Need**: [Specific feedback or requirement]
**Key Changes**: 
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
**Files Modified**: [List key files]
**Research Impact**: [How this supports research goals]
```

## Deployment
- Repository: https://github.com/SiruiruiRen/learning-bot
- Auto-deployment on push to main branch
- No migrations needed during testing phase - direct SQL execution in Supabase
