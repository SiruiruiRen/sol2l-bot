Commit and Deployment Workflow Rule:
https://github.com/SiruiruiRen/learning-bot

Stage: After verifying all code changes, I will stage all modified files using git add ..
Commit: I will commit the staged files with a clear, descriptive message summarizing the changes (e.g., git commit -m "feat: Implement Phase 5 and UI fixes").
Push: I will push the commit to the main branch of the remote repository on GitHub, which will automatically trigger deployments.
