# Feedback System Guide

## Overview
The feedback system in the summary page collects user responses about their learning experience.

## Key Components
- [app/summary/page.tsx](mdc:app/summary/page.tsx) - Contains the feedback form implementation

## Feedback Questions
The system collects quantitative feedback using a 1-5 rating scale for three key metrics:
1. Usefulness of learning strategies
2. Overall satisfaction with the experience
3. Likelihood to recommend to others

There's also an optional text field for additional comments.

## Implementation Details
- Uses `RadioGroup` and `RadioGroupItem` components for the rating scale
- Stores responses in a React state object
- Has a submit function that currently displays an alert
